Than some fictional scenarios will be used to show some of the website features. Next the design-in-the-small of the site's pages is going to be explained through a low-fidelty wireframe fro each one of them, showing the basic visual organization of contents, navigation and interaction elements on the “screen”. In the end the database structure will be explained by the means of the Entity Relationship Model on two levels of abstraction.\\
