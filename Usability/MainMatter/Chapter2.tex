\chapter{Results}
For execution of the test some rules about the task performance are used.
Starting from the scoring method considered for the task success, the one used is the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete success (without assistance) = 1
\item Partial success, or if assistance given = 0.5
\item Gives up or wrong answer = 0
\end{itemize}
For the determination of unsuccessful tasks, a task is considered unsuccessful if one of the following condition is matched:
\begin{itemize}
\item The user give up on trying to complete the task
\item Three wrong paths, or three attempts from the start
\item The cut-off time (threshold) is elapsed (for this test 4 minutes are chosen as cut-off time)
\end{itemize}
At last, action is considered an error if:
\begin{itemize}
\item The user enter incorrect data into a form field
\item The user makes the wrong choice in a menu or drop-down list
\item The user takes an incorrect sequence of actions
\item The user fails to take a key action
\end{itemize}
